# sibilla

Sibilla is a Java framework designed to support analysis of Collective Adaptive Systems. These are systems composed by a large set of interactive agents that cooperate and compete to reach local and global goals. 

Sibilla is thought of *container* where different tools supporting specification and analysis of concurrent and distributed large scaled systems can be integrated. Currently Sibilla includes:

* API for *system simulation*;
* API for *transient analysis* via *statistical model checking*;
* API for modelling *population models*.
